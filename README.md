# RipRally


This is the version I created becuase the IOS cloud build kept failing.
It failed sayign that it couldnt find the UnityAds plugin.
I upgraded to Unity 2020 and it still failed albeit with a different error
So I created an empty unity project and gradually added all the assets.

Other versions are:
RipRally-Copy This is the 2019 version that wouldn't cloud build
RipRally-Failed This is Unity2020.3 version wouldn't cloud build
RipRally-Failed2 Copy of Failed

So I got all the way to the RaceSelector Scene. Then the Excavating hung
Need to create a development build (Option In Dashboard Advanced Settings)
