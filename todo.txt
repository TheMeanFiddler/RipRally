Set up app-ads.txt for your apps
The app-ads.txt initiative helps fight fraud and safeguard your app ads earnings. Use these instructions to set up app-ads.txt for your AdMob apps.

If you haven't already, create an app-ads.txt file using the spec provided by IAB Tech Lab.
Copy and paste the following code snippet into your app-ads.txt file:
google.com, pub-1062887910651588, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0

Publish your app-ads.txt on the root of your developer website (for example, sampledomain.com/app-ads.txt). Make sure the domain is entered exactly as listed on Google Play or the App Store.
Wait at least 24 hours for AdMob to crawl and verify your app-ads.txt file.
Open AdMob, go to your apps, and click the app-ads.txt tab to check your app-ads.txt status.
